        "\n",
        "Financial institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, rely on credit scores to assess an individual's creditworthiness. These numerical scores serve as a crucial factor in determining whether to approve or deny loan applications and credit card issuances. In the modern era, banks and credit card companies have embraced Machine Learning algorithms to automate the process of classifying their vast customer databases based on credit histories. If you're interested in learning how to apply Machine Learning techniques for credit score classification, this article is tailored for you. Throughout this article, we'll delve into the task of credit score classification using Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python.\n",
