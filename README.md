# ðŸ’« Credit Score Classification

The credit score of a person determines their creditworthiness, which is a crucial factor for financial companies in deciding whether to approve or deny loan or credit applications. A higher credit score indicates a lower risk of default, while a lower credit score suggests a higher risk. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify credit scores based on various factors, providing valuable insights for financial institutions and individuals alike.

## Introduction

Credit score classification is a supervised learning task that involves training a machine learning model to predict the credit score category (e.g., poor, fair, good, excellent) based on various features or attributes related to an individual's financial history and behavior. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to build an accurate and reliable credit score classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to an individual's financial profile, such as annual income, monthly salary, number of credit cards, outstanding debt, credit history age, and more. The target variable is the credit score category, which is classified into different levels (e.g., poor, fair, good, excellent).

The dataset can be obtained from [insert dataset source or link].

## Features

The following features are used in the credit score classification model:

- Annual Income
- Monthly Inhand Salary
- Number of Bank Accounts
- Number of Credit Cards
- Interest Rate
- Number of Loans
- Average Number of Days Delayed for Credit Card Payments
- Number of Delayed Payments
- Credit Mix (Bad, Standard, Good)
- Outstanding Debt
- Credit History Age
- Monthly Balance
